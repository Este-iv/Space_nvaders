Assignment 2.0
Ascii invaders.

What I did well for the code is that i was able to make the code from scratch.
Its all in C++. The code had to be redone halfway through the week and i had
major bug issue with the game, pushing me back on time. I owe it to TA Zach for
his help when i had to re do the game. The game cannot shoot, and technically
the assignment called for a weeks worth of what we would do for rlg,
Almost Everything works in the game you are able to move left and right, and
the issue is that it cannot shoot so that is a big point where you cannot get point or check
if the game will end of not with out using shift Q.
I hope this is good, I really have worked hard on this game, for having to
re do it all Wednesday.. I really poured myself out on this game. I hope my work is 
shown.
